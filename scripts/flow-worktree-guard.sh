# flow-worktree-guard.sh - Warn when a flow edit LEAKED into the MAIN repo
# working tree instead of landing in the active worktree (issue #486).
#
# Motivation: in a native `EnterWorktree` session the session cwd IS the
# worktree, but the worktree physically lives inside the main repo at
# `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`. A `Write`/`Edit` given a hand-built ABSOLUTE
# `.claude/worktrees/<name>/...` path has been observed (flow:auto #442 x2, #471)
# to modify the file in the MAIN repo working tree instead of the worktree - work
# looks done but is written to the wrong tree, either lost or left as a stray
# dirty file on main that other concurrent sessions then see.
#
# The durable fix is a directive: resolve edit paths from
# `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (the active worktree root), never a hand-built
# `.claude/worktrees/...` absolute path. This guard is the VERIFIABLE backstop for
# that directive: run from inside a linked worktree, it inspects the MAIN repo's
# TRACKED working tree and warns loudly if anything there is modified - the
# signature of a leaked edit - so the trap is caught before commit rather than
# discovered later.
#
# Scope: only meaningful in a linked-worktree session (`.git` is a file). In the
# main checkout itself (`.git` is a directory) there is no "other tree" to leak
# into, so the guard is a no-op. A git-fallback worktree (manual `git worktree
# add`, cwd not a native session) does not hit the trap either, but the main-tree
# cleanliness check is still valid there, so it runs in any linked worktree.
#
# Usage:
#   flow-worktree-guard.sh [--strict]
#
# Options:
#   --strict   Exit non-zero (3) when the main working tree has tracked
#              modifications. Default is advisory: always exit 0, just warn.
#
# Output:
#   Prints a "[flow] WARNING" block naming the modified main-repo paths with a
#   remediation hint. Prints nothing (exit 0) when main is clean or when not in
#   a linked worktree.
#
# Env (test hook - unset in normal use):
#   FLOW_WORKTREE_GIT   override the `git` binary (default: git)
